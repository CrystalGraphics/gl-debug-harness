/**
 * Presents real OS cursors via LWJGL2, for the CSS {@code cursor} property the engine resolves.
 *
 * <p>Lives in the harness because {@code core/} may not import LWJGL at all — the import guard fails
 * the build on it. This is the reference implementation of {@link CgCursorService}; MC 1.7.10 is also
 * LWJGL2 and can reuse it almost verbatim, while an LWJGL3/GLFW loader has a much easier job
 * (<code>glfwCreateStandardCursor</code> covers the whole resize set).</p>
 *
 * <h3>Three LWJGL2 details that are easy to get wrong</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Images are bottom-up, and the hotspot's Y is measured from the bottom.</b> Every drawing
 *       function in {@link CgCursorBitmaps} works top-down like the rest of this codebase, so the flip
 *       happens here, once, in {@link #toCursor}. Getting this wrong produces a vertically mirrored
 *       cursor whose hotspot is at the wrong end — and for a symmetric double-arrow the mirroring is
 *       invisible, so only the hotspot would give it away.</li>
 *   <li><b>Cursors must be a size the platform accepts</b>, which in practice means 32×32 on Windows.
 *       {@code org.lwjgl.input.Cursor.getMinCursorSize()}/{@code getMaxCursorSize()} are checked rather than assumed,
 *       and a platform outside that range gets the system arrow instead of a crash.</li>
 *   <li><b>Native cursors need the capability bit.</b> Without
 *       {@code CURSOR_ONE_BIT_TRANSPARENCY} there is no cursor support at all, and creating one
 *       throws.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Cursors are created lazily and cached <b>by shape</b> (see {@link Shape}), so the eighteen mapped
 * CSS keywords share six native objects rather than allocating one each. Anything without artwork maps
 * to {@code null}, which is LWJGL2's way of restoring the system arrow — a better answer than a wrong
 * picture, and the right one for most of the keyword set.</p>
