/**
 * CrystalOS, hands-on — the compositor scene, and the one place any of it can be driven by hand.
 *
 * <h3>This is the {@code windowing} scene, on the M6 engine</h3>
 *
 * <p>A PORT of that file rather than a fresh scene, and deliberately: it is the compositor's manual,
 * written a W at a time as {@code plan/shell-windowing.md} shipped, and everything it tells you to try is a
 * thing somebody built the demonstration for on the day. Rewriting it would have thrown that away and
 * quietly replaced it with whatever this engine happened to make easy — the difference between a scene
 * that can find a regression and one that can only show what already works.</p>
 *
 * <p>So far: W1 geometry and chrome, W2 stacking and activation, W3 the lifecycle, W4 the taskbar,
 * W5 window-scoped modality, W6 maximise and restore, W7 the editor as a window, W8 tool-window
 * tear-out, W10 the switcher, W12 persistence and the no-steal rule, W13a the window command set and
 * its system menu, W13b Alt-drag, fullscreen and snap, W14 game mode.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What to do in here</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Drag a title bar.</b> The clamp is Windows', not a panel's: a window may hang off the sides
 *       and the bottom, and its caption can never leave the top. Push one into a corner to see which
 *       edges give. <i>(W1)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Drag any edge or corner.</b> All eight handles come from {@code resize: both} in
 *       {@code ua/desktop.css} — nothing in {@code WindowFrame} builds them. <i>(W1)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Overlap them and click the one behind.</b> It comes forward <em>and the click still
 *       lands</em> — press a button in a background window and watch it both raise the window and
 *       press. The caption of the active one is coloured; the rest go quiet. <i>(W2)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Click a button in one window, switch to another, and click back.</b> Focus returns to the
 *       button you left, not to the first thing in the window — and clicking a title bar to drag does
 *       not count as leaving it. <i>(W2)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Click bare desktop.</b> No window is active, which is a legal state and what every desktop
 *       does when you click its background. <i>(W2)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Resize the harness window.</b> Every frame re-clamps against the new work area, and windows
 *       pushed in by a shrinking desktop go back to where you put them when the room returns.
 *       <i>(W1)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>F2 opens another window</b>, placed by the Win32 cascade — one caption height further along
 *       each time, wrapping back to the origin when the next step would put it off the work area.
 *       <i>(W1)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Minimise a window and watch its tick counter stop.</b> That counter is the whole point of
 *       the freeze: a hidden window is <em>detached</em>, so it lays out nothing, paints nothing, holds
 *       no input state and runs nothing either. Its taskbar entry brings it back and the counter
 *       <em>resumes from where it stopped</em>, which is retention working rather than a window being
 *       rebuilt. <i>(W3)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>The strip along the bottom.</b> One entry per window that exists — a minimised one is
 *       dimmed, never dropped, because the entry IS the way back. Click an entry to bring its window
 *       forward; click the entry of the window you are already in and it minimises, which is the toggle
 *       that makes a taskbar a taskbar. The entries never move: open order, whatever you activate.
 *       <i>(W4)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Press "Modal" and the dialog blocks ONE window.</b> The window it belongs to stops
 *       answering clicks and dims behind a backdrop; every other window, and the taskbar, stays
 *       completely live — drag them, click their buttons, minimise them. Escape closes the dialog
 *       first and the window second, which is the cascade in one gesture. <i>(W5)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Maximise, or double-click a caption.</b> A maximised window fills the WORK AREA — the
 *       taskbar's row is not part of it, because the strip is laid out rather than overlaid — its
 *       resize handles go away, and its glyph turns into "restore". Then <b>drag its title bar</b>: it
 *       comes loose under the pointer, keeping the same fraction across the caption. A press alone does
 *       nothing, or a double-click could never work. <i>(W6)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>The Crystal Editor is a window here.</b> The whole workbench — file tree, tabs, dock,
 *       panels — inside a {@code WindowFrame}, over the harness's own workspace, sharing the desktop
 *       with everything else. <b>Its menu lives in the window's caption</b> — client-side decorations,
 *       so there is one header rather than two stacked on each other. <i>(W7)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>The close button</b> destroys by default, and the window behind it takes over. The Welcome
 *       window is deliberately {@code HIDE_ON_CLOSE} instead — close it and it minimises. <i>(W3)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>F4 opens a window WITHOUT taking focus</b> — the no-steal rule. Type in the editor while you
 *       press it: the caret never moves, the editor keeps its lit caption, and the new window goes in
 *       <em>behind</em> it. Its taskbar entry is highlighted until you click it, carries a <b>badge</b>,
 *       and <b>fills with progress</b> for four seconds before both go away. <b>Middle-click any
 *       entry</b> to close its window through its own policy. <i>(W12)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Move the windows, quit, and run it again.</b> They come back where you left them, in the
 *       order you left them, with the minimised ones still minimised. <i>(W12)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Right-click a title bar. Right-click a taskbar entry. Press {@code Alt+-}.</b> The same
 *       four rows in three places, because they are one command set with three renderers — Restore,
 *       Minimize, Maximize, Close, each greyed exactly when it does not apply. <b>Restore and Maximize
 *       are two rows</b>, as Win32's are, rather than one whose label changes under you. <i>(W13a)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Right-click the entry of a window that is NOT in front, and choose Minimize.</b> It
 *       minimises <em>that</em> window, not the one you were looking at. A taskbar entry is not inside
 *       the window it stands for, so it has to say which window it means. <i>(W13a)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Hold Alt and drag anywhere inside a window</b> — over its content, over a button, over the
 *       editor's text. The Linux WM staple, and the answer for a window whose title bar is tiny or
 *       covered by adopted chrome. It takes the press in the CAPTURE phase, which is the whole of what
 *       makes "anywhere" true. <i>(W13b)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Drag a window's caption to the left or right edge.</b> A translucent rectangle shows where
 *       it will land — <em>behind</em> the window you are dragging, so it reads as a hole in the desktop
 *       rather than a sheet over your hand — and releasing snaps it to that half. <b>Drag to the top</b>
 *       to maximise. Press Escape mid-drag and the preview goes with it. <i>(W13b)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>F11 fullscreens</b> the active window: it fills the desktop and the taskbar goes with it.
 *       Nothing special had to be built — the strip is <em>laid out</em>, so hiding it re-flows the work
 *       area and the maximised window follows. <i>(W13b)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Open the system menu and choose Move, then use the arrows.</b> Enter keeps the result,
 *       Escape puts the window back <em>exactly</em> where it was, Shift nudges finely, and any other
 *       key ends the mode and still does whatever it was going to do. This is the only way to move a
 *       window whose title bar has ended up off the work area. <i>(W13c)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Right-click the taskbar itself</b> — the strip, not an entry — for <b>Show Desktop</b>.
 *       Everything minimises; run it again and exactly what it took comes back. Two menus on one strip,
 *       and the distinction is what they are about: an entry's names a window, the strip's names the
 *       desktop. <i>(W13c)</i></li>
 *   <li><b>Look for a chord beside Close. There isn't one.</b> {@code Ctrl+W} closes an editor tab —
 *       frequent, cheap, undoable — and a window takes its content with it, so the destructive one is
 *       deliberately not a keystroke away from the common one. <i>(W13a)</i></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The readout window is deliberately a <em>live</em> one rather than text painted over the scene: it
 * is the only way to watch the clamp arithmetic while dragging, and it doubles as content that proves a
 * window clips what it holds.</p>
 *
 * <h3>What the port changed, and none of it is a choice</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The tick counter is an OWNED hook.</b> The old one was a {@code UIFrameTicker} that had to
 *       return false once its element left the tree, and re-register itself from {@code onShown}
 *       because registration was one-way — the widget's half of the freeze, and the half that is
 *       invisible when it is missing. {@code Animation.every(owner, hook)} is dropped when the owner
 *       is frozen, so the counter is only a counter now. The demonstration is unchanged; the contract
 *       it was demonstrating is gone.</li>
 *   <li><b>The modal is {@code attachOwned}</b> where the old scene called
 *       {@code uiWindow.addOverlay(dialog, owner.content())}. Same surface, named by the frame.</li>
 *   <li><b>Every size here is in LOGICAL pixels</b>, which is half the surface at this scene's 2x. The
 *       old scene ran at 1x and its numbers are its own — a 560x380 editor there is the whole desktop
 *       here, which is exactly what the first run of this port did.</li>
 * </ul>
