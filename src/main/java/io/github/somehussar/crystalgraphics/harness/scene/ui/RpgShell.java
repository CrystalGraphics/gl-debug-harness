/**
 * RPG-Core's own {@code MenuShell}, loaded off the classpath the consumer put us on.
 *
 * <h3>Why reflection</h3>
 *
 * <p>The harness cannot depend on RPG-Core: RPG-Core depends on CrystalGUI, and the harness is one of
 * CrystalGUI's own subprojects. What that leaves is a second copy of the shell living here and
 * drifting from the one that ships — and a screenshot of a copy is evidence about the copy.</p>
 *
 * <p>So the classes arrive through {@code -Pharness.extraClasspath} and the four calls the scene needs
 * are made by name. The cost is contained in this one file: everything the scene touches afterwards is
 * an ordinary {@link UIElement}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why a tab is a String here</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@code onSelect} takes a {@code Consumer<MenuTab>} and generics are erased, so a plain
 * {@code Consumer} passes through {@code Method.invoke} unharmed. The enum constant that arrives
 * cannot be named on this side, so it is read through {@code toString()} — which for an enum is its
 * constant name, and the scene keys its pages on those.</p>
