/**
 * Installs the canonical sheet stack into a scene's style engine, with a theme on it.
 *
 * <p>Three steps that have to happen together, which is why they are one call: register the theme
 * file, activate it, and install {@code StyleSheet.DEFAULT} + the theme's own override sheet + the
 * scheme sheet into the engine. A scene that adds {@code StyleSheet.DEFAULT} by hand — which every
 * CrystalGUI scene did before this existed — gets a theme's <b>tokens</b> and none of its
 * <b>rules</b>, because the rules live in a sheet {@code UiThemeManager} owns and only
 * {@code installInto} adds. Tokens reach most of the look, so the result is a scene that is
 * three-quarters themed and reports nothing about the missing quarter.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Overriding from the command line</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dcrystalgui.theme=<ns:name>} chooses a different theme and {@code -Dcrystalgui.scheme}
 * an editor colour scheme; {@code none} for either means unthemed, which is how a scene is compared
 * against the bare user-agent sheet. {@code runHarness} forwards every {@code -Dcrystalgui.*} into
 * the forked JVM, so these need no Gradle plumbing.</p>
 *
 * <p>A theme outside the engine's own jar needs its resources reachable — see
 * {@code -Pharness.assetRoots} in {@code build.gradle.kts}.</p>
