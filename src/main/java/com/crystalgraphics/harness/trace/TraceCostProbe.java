/**
 * What the trace engine costs a frame when nothing is recording — the "every channel off" gate.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * long start = System.nanoTime();
 * ... the scene's frame and paint ...
 * if (probe.frame(System.nanoTime() - start)) running = false;   // true once it has printed
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Alternates blocks of frames with every channel off and every CPU channel on, timing the scene's own
 * work (never the swap, which vsync would clamp). A build without the engine cannot be made, so the gate
 * is derived: the on-minus-off difference divided by the events recorded gives what one recorded call
 * costs, and the calls a frame makes times the measured cost of a DISABLED call is what the engine costs
 * with everything off. Prints {@code [trace-cost]} lines.</p>
 *
 * <p>Leaves out {@code crystalgui.blame}, which walks a stack per invalidation and is no ordinary call,
 * and the GPU and image channels, which issue GL work rather than record.</p>
